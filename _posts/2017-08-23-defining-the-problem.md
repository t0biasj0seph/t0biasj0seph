title: "Defining the Problem"

Today my focus will about defining what I want in my next position. Defining this is hard for me because I have a diverse set of skills and I like ulitizing all of them. My last position was 60% management, 30% sales, 5% marketing and 5% customer service. We had plans for my role to be more marketing focused so I attended conferences and generated several ideas to work into a campaign, but we couldn't make the time. My management counter-part's role was 60% customer service, 30% management, and 10% server management. Between the two of us, we ultilized our team to:
* keep the phones covered
* intake all feature requests (which included gathering requirements, deciding on hours, writing an SOW, sending it through approval and sending it to the customer), prioritize bugs and implement temporary fixes if possible, manage online ticketing system
* keep all servers updated and patched
* hold weekly status meetings with key clients with features in house
* scheduling tasks/projects for the engineers
* plan software releases and develop informational materials for customers about each release

What that it?
