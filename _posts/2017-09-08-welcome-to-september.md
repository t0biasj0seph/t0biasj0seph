I really wanted to blog everyday. I thought I'd be able to do it. I made it 2.5 days. You would assume three, but I know I didn't truly finish that third day's blog and that I wanted to write a second post that day. I love writing, I just let the little things get in the way. Anyways, this is me pushing through.

OH MY GOODNESS. I JUST DID THE STRENGTHFINDERS2.0 ASSESSMENT AND I AM SO EXCITED AND ENERGIZED. The assessment basically told me I was born to be a workaholic, just what I've always wanted to be told. Work gives me great purpose. It's the reason why I want to own my own company someday, or start a non-profit, or become a leader in a reptuable organization. I believe our brains are these wonderful things we're provided with and we should use them to do better and change the world. Work hard, play hard, enjoy life, believe in people, do.kick.ass.things.

Here's my strengths. I'm going to list them and go over how they make me feel.

1. Futuristic
2. Achiever
3. Arranger
4. Activator
5. Belief

In general, the results excite me. I am in a transition period in my life and my career, and these insights give me validation for my recent actions and current directives. I love to work hard and I love to give my all. I cannot wait to be doing just that.
