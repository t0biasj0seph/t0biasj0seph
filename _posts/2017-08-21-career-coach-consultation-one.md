Today may mark the day I put together my first website, but because I've programmed before the more important point was that I "met" with a potential career coach. I'm hungry for the right fit and after submitting 40+ resumes and knowing that I have enough drive to figure out any role, I've decided to explore new options for landing the career of my dreams in my new town of Franklin, TN. More to come - I have meetings with four more "Career Coaches" this week and then I'll give my 411 of the LinkedIn Profinder and "Career Coaches" in general.

P.S. - All those posts about the job search sucking - they're real. It's like navigating a corn maze, but your friends/acquaintances ignore you or send you in the wrong direction and the blabbing strangers are the ones that sincerely want to help. Beware of those asking you to reach out to ask questions in your circle of influence, they may just want that "send us a candidate" bonus.

P.S.S. - Working with a team you love and a product you believe in makes the tough experience worth it. I've been there before and I'll get there again.

P.S.S.S. - I really miss my delete key. I just began utilizing it about a year ago and since getting a Chromebook I've been confused.

P.S.S.S.S. - Markdown and Jekyll are sweet. I'm estatic to have a new simple way to blog, but where's my spell check? Is there an Atom add-on I should know about?
