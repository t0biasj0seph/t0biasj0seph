title: "Web Development is About Finding the Right Tutorial"
date: 2017-08-22

After searching through 20 tutorials, uninstalling and reinstalling RVM and Ruby a few times, I figured it out. I was able to install Jekyll and I am making progress on my original tutorial. Web development for me has always been about finding the right resources online, which is difficult because there are so many different environments. It's been a few years since I've deployed any code, but it's exciting and fun just like before. I still think about what I would be doing if I finished my computer science degree, but I know it didn't make sense. I wanted to do web development, not program commands for cell phone chips, like my program was focused on. Interdisciplinary Studies was a great blessing for me. I learned about myself, my management styles, and about managing others. Working with cross-functional teams and across departments comes naturally for me with my small business - wear many hats - background. Anways, it took me roughly eight hours to navigate Google to accomplish deploying a blog site to my custom domain - I'm proud!
