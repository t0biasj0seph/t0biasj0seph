  <h3>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.</h3>
    <p>I will use this site as my portfolio as I am building it from scratch, with the help of GitHub Pages and a list of tutorials, on my Chromebook (an adventure in and of itself). Please stay tuned while I get things set up. 8/21/2017</p>
